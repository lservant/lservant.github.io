    This project is the result of careful examination of the first level of the first entry of the most famous platformer of all time. 
    
    It emulates the design of the original, with originally created sprites, music, and sound effects. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a game in Godot that feels as close to the original as possible within a month of development.
  features: 
    - Walk, run, and jump as Bario through a copy of level 1-1
    - Stomp on enemies to get points, grow up with power orbs, and find secrets ducking into pipes
    - Take down the flag of the evil empire and try to get the highest score
