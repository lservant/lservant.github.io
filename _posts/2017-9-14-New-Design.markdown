After a very long time of not updating this website and being gainfully employed at 2(TWO!) software development gigs, I've shipped my first indie web app called [TeStatistics][ts].  It's a little app I made for my girlfriend after a weekend of manually gathering statistics from a test she gave to her classes.  That was a pain in the butt, and I thought I'd make that task a little more enjoyable.  I'll be adding features as she requests them or as I think about them.

On top of that I feel that my old website design was getting a little dated, and I'd learned a lot of things about doing it myself since then.  So I did a ground up redesign using Foundation, which I feel is much less opinionated in its design philosophy.  Or maybe I just like its minimalist approach.  Idk.  I'll probably tinker with it some more as time goes on.
